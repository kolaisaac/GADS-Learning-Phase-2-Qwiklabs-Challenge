# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Welcome to my GADS Learning Phase 2 Qwiklabs Challenge page!**

## GADS means Google Africa Developer Scholarship

The Google Africa Developer Scholarship (GADS) program gives free access to Pluralsight course content plus support from the Andela Learning Community in chosen skills development track. 

### [Grow with Google](https://grow.google), [Andela](https://andela.com/alc) and [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com) have partnered to provide a new program to support software developers in Africa on Android, Google Cloud and Mobile Web skills development tracks. The aim of this program is to continuously engage with aspiring and existing developers to help them become professional developers with skills that can get them opportunities after the program. 

**Am on the Google Cloud tracks**

All Google Cloud learners have access to multiple learning channels on Pluralsight. 
Due to limitations in regards to accessing free Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the Google Cloud challenge is based on the available hands-on labs on Qwiklabs provided by Pluralsight.
