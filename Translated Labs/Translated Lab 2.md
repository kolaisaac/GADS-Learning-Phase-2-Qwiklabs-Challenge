## Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:
- Download a sample app from GitHub
- Deploy to App Engine
- Deploy to Kubernetes Engine
- Deploy to Cloud Run

## Set up your lab environment

For each lab, you get a new GCP project and set of resources for a fixed time at no cost.

1. Make sure you signed into Qwiklabs using an incognito window.
2. Note the lab's access time (for example, ![Time Count](/images/TimeCount.png) and make sure you can finish in that time block.
```
There is no pause feature. You can restart if needed, but you have to start at the beginning.
```
3. When ready, click ![Start Lab](/images/StartLabClick.png).
4. Note your lab credentials. You will use them to sign in to Cloud Platform Console.

5. Click **Open Google Console**.

6. Click **Use another account** and copy/paste credentials for **this** lab into the prompts.

```
If you use other credentials, you'll get errors or incur charges.
```
7. Accept the terms and skip the recovery resource page.
```
Do not click End Lab unless you are finished with the lab or want to restart it.
This clears your work and removes the project.
